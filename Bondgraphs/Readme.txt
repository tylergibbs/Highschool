bond-symbolic-solver

Solves a bond graph allowing it to simulate many physical systems to a fist degree of accuracy. Bond graphs allow one to encode most physical systems in an abstract format that translates to a system of differential equations, which are then solved using a symbolic method.

Bond-matrix-solver

As above except uses eigenvalues and vectors to solve the system of differential equations.
