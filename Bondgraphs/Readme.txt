\
bond-symbolic-solver\
\
Solves a bond graph allowing it to simulate many physical systems to a fist degree of accuracy. Bond graphs allow one to encode most physical systems in an abstract format that translates to a system of differential equations, which are then solved using a symbolic method.\
\
Bond-matrix-solver\
\
As above except uses eigenvalues and vectors to solve the system of differential equations.}
