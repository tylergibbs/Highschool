wireframe.rkt

This file runs a projection of an 4 dimensional world into a 2 dimensional screen. Allows rotation along 6 degrees of freedom(xy, xz, xw, yz, yw, zw) of both the camera and individual objects, as well as translation in 8 directions. It works in up to N dimensions although the current set up only displays a 4 dimensional tesseract.

4d solid with color

gui.rkt When run will produce images of a tesseract with solid colored faces rotated 10 degrees in a random direction each images.
